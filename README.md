# HiCt_Sequencing-Informatics-Pipeline
HiCt is a sequencing approach using nested PCR and Illumina NGS sequencing technology to recover low-copy number samples (high Ct values from qPCR). This high sensitivity sequencing approach has been used for SARS-CoV-2 genomic recovery from White-Tailed Deer, ICU patients, and more.
